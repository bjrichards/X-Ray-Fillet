# X-Ray Fillet
A bullet-hell game, X-Ray Fillet was originally began as an entry for a game jam back in 2020. Since I enjoyed working on it, it has become a long-lived project of mine.

Due to this project being a lower priority project on my GitHub, development is very slow. 

I am now mainly using this project as a sandbox for python features or game features I am using in other projects. 

This game is expected to be finished with development by November of 2022. It will be released on itch.io
